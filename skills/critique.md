# Skill: critique

> **External observer.** Visit the live site as a first-time

> **Rate-limited** by `/march` (≥12 commits + ≥24h spacing,
> green-deploy required). Cap of 6 filed findings per pass.

## 1. Purpose

The autonomous loop is good at shipping what it was told to
ship. It's bad at noticing when the shipped result doesn't
read well as a real reader would experience it.

`/critique` is the corrective lens.

## 2. Invocation

```
/critique                    # full pass — see auth handling below
/critique <url>              # focused pass on one URL
/critique mobile             # 375×800 only
/critique desktop            # 1280×800 only
/critique anonymous          # public/anonymous pass only (skip auth)
/critique authenticated      # logged-in pass only (requires Auth: != none)
```

**Auth handling for tiered.tv.** Bearings declares
`Auth: session-cookie`. **Default `/critique` runs TWO passes
in sequence** — both required, both filed:

- **Anonymous pass** — no cookie attached. Walks the URL set
  as a first-time visitor would. Captures: hero copy,
  sign-in CTA visibility, the spoiler shield, vote-pair
  affordance in its un-acted state, comment-area
  "sign in to comment" prompt, public canon + community
  pages.
- **Authenticated pass** — cookie attached as the
  `e2e@tiered.app` user. Walks the URL set as a returning
  member would. Captures: /sign-in's authed-redirect target,
  /u/[handle] for itself, the comment-input affordance in
  its live state, the vote-pair in its post-click state with
  delta animation, the "your account" chrome.

The cookie comes from `CRITIQUE_SESSION_COOKIE` (env var
auto-managed by `scripts/mint-e2e-cookie.mjs`). Pre-flight
in Step 0 ensures it's fresh before invoking `reader`.

Findings tagged `auth_state: "anon"` or `"authed"` in the
filing (see Step 4). Coverage is union, not intersection —
the same finding present in both passes is filed once
(reader sub-agent dedupes by message).

Argument overrides:
- `/critique anonymous` → run only the anon pass.
- `/critique authenticated` → run only the authed pass.
- `/critique mobile` / `/critique desktop` → viewport-only,
  still both auth passes unless combined with the auth args.

When invoked from `/march`, conditions are pre-checked.

## 3. The page set (default full pass)

Pick **representative**, not exhaustive. The smoke walker
already covers every URL; critique is for *quality*.

### Anonymous page set (always)

| Page | Why critique it |
|---|---|
| `/` (home) | First impression. The fold matters. |
| `/<canonical-detail>/<latest>` | Canonical reading experience. |
| `/<pillar-or-category>` | Pillar voice + card cascade. |
| `/<signature-feature>` | Project's most distinctive surface (when public). |
| `/<list-or-index>` | Faceted browse path. |

### Authenticated page set (only when `Auth: != none`)

| Page | Why critique it |
|---|---|
| `/<post-login-landing>` (typically `/dashboard`, `/app`, or `/home`) | What the user actually sees first. |
| `/<canonical-detail-in-app>/<latest>` | The in-app version of the reading/working experience. |
| `/<settings>` | Where users diagnose problems. Reflects voice + clarity. |
| `/<signature-feature>` (logged-in version) | The product's most distinctive surface for real users. |
| `/<empty-or-onboarding-state>` | Often where the experience breaks down. |

The bot user's data shape matters here — see
`nexus/customization/auth-aware-critique.md` "What does your
bot user look like?". Curate it once so the authenticated
pass walks through representative state, not an empty
account.

Skip pages that don't exist yet. Note in pass log.

## 4. Delegate to `reader`

The `reader` sub-agent at `.claude/agents/reader.md` is the
fresh-eyes observer. **Always delegate the visit.** Reasons:

- It has browser tools (`mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`) for richer
  findings than WebFetch.
- Fresh sub-agent context = genuine first-time-reader perspective.
- Output is structured JSON; easy to filter and file.

**Tooling path selection.** Locally, `reader` uses Path A
(Chrome MCP). **In the cloud loop** (GitHub Actions — no Chrome
MCP) `reader` uses **Path A2 — the Playwright walk**
(`scripts/critique-walk.mjs`), which the runner can drive
because chromium is already cached for e2e. Path A2 runs in a
fresh isolated context, so the shared-profile false-finding
class that made `/critique` local-only is structurally
impossible there — this is what makes a cloud `/critique` pass
trustworthy. Tell `reader` which path applies (it auto-selects
A2 when Chrome MCP is absent, but the prompt should name it for
the cloud case). Path B (WebFetch) only when neither is
available.

Pass it:
- The URL list.
- The **pass mode** (`anonymous` or `authenticated`).
- Voice cue from `plan/bearings.md`.
- Current `plan/CRITIQUE.md` Done section (so it doesn't
  re-surface addressed findings).
- Focus areas from invocation argument.

It returns a JSON array of findings, each carrying
`auth_state`. When the default invocation runs both passes,
spawn `reader` **twice** (once per mode) and concatenate
results before §6 (self-assessment + filing).

Findings tagged `auth_state: "auth-failed"` are filed as
`[needs-user-call]` in `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s Pending block —
not scored as product bugs. The user resolves the auth
config (refresh the session cookie, fix the login selectors,
etc.) and the next pass re-runs.

## 5. The procedure

### Step 0 — Pre-flight

```bash
git pull --ff-only
pnpm deploy:check
node scripts/mint-e2e-cookie.mjs    # refreshes CRITIQUE_SESSION_COOKIE if stale
```

If no green deploy: defer. Write a one-line entry to CRITIQUE.md
"deferred at <date>: no green deploy" and exit 0. **Don't commit
on no-ops.**

If the mint script fails (Auth0 unreachable, password-realm
grant disabled, test user banned): file a single
`[needs-user-call]` row in CRITIQUE.md describing the failure
and run only the anonymous pass. Don't block the whole
critique on auth — the anon pass is still useful.

### Step 1 — Build the page set

Default §3. Adjust based on argument, phase progress (skip
non-existent pages), recent shipping focus.

### Step 2 — Spawn `reader`

```
Agent({
  subagent_type: "reader",
  prompt: "Visit these URLs of https://tiered.tv: [list].
           Voice cue from plan/bearings.md: <quote>.
           Already-addressed (skip): <Done section>.
           Focus: <from arg or 'general'>.
           Return ≤ 8 findings as JSON per your output spec."
})
```

Wait for return.

### Step 3 — Self-assess

Reader returns observations; you decide which deserve to land.
For each:

1. **Valid?** Can evidence be re-verified? Drop session-specific
   artifacts.
2. **Actionable?** Can a future `/iterate` tick fix with
   resources at hand? If not, file as `[needs-user-call]`.
3. **Duplicate?** If CRITIQUE.md has an open row for this exact
   issue, drop new + bump older's severity.
4. **Severity match impact?** Re-rate if needed.
5. **Suggested fix sane?** If contradicts bearings or contracts,
   replace with compatible fix.

After assessment, **3–6 findings**, not 8.

### Step 4 — Append to `plan/CRITIQUE.md`

```markdown
# Critique log

> Last pass: <ISO date> at commit <sha>
> Pass count: <N>

## Pending

### [HIGH] /<url> — <one-line>
- pass: <N> (commit <sha>)
- viewport: desktop | mobile
- category: <visual | comprehension | navigation | voice | mobile | performance | a11y | seo>
- observation: <what was seen>
- evidence: <screenshot region | quoted text | console msg>
- suggested fix: <one-line concrete change>
- source: browser | web-fetch

## Done

### [x] [MED] <url> — ... (pass <N>; addressed at <sha>)
```

Update metadata header.

### Step 5 — Commit + push

```bash
git add plan/CRITIQUE.md
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
critique: pass <N> — <K> findings (<H> high, <M> medium, <L> low)

Visited: <list of URLs>.
Findings filed to plan/CRITIQUE.md Pending.
Address loop: /iterate will pick the highest-scoring finding.
EOF
)"
git push origin main
```

If **zero** findings (rare): still update metadata, commit
`critique: pass <N> — no findings`. Pass counter is the signal
`/march` reads.

### Step 6 — Confirm deploy

```bash
pnpm deploy:check
```

### Step 7 — Done

Return 3-line summary.

## 6. Hard rules

1. **Never modify code, content, or data.** Findings only.
2. **Always delegate the visit to `reader`.** Don't visit from
   main agent context.
3. **Self-assess after reader returns.** Don't file raw
   observations.
4. **Cap at 6 filed findings per pass.** 8 is reader's input
   cap; 6 is your output cap.
5. **Never duplicate Pending or Done entries.**
6. **One commit per pass.**
7. **No emojis. No `Co-Authored-By:`.**

## 7. Failure modes

1. **No green deploy.** Defer.
2. **`reader` returns malformed output.** Re-spawn once with
   stricter format. If fails again, write single finding "reader
   sub-agent malfunction at pass <N>", commit, exit 1.
3. **No URLs in page set** (very early phases). Defer.
4. **`git pull` divergence.**

## 8. Address loop contract (how `/iterate` consumes findings)

`plan/CRITIQUE.md` `## Pending` is `/iterate`'s queue:
- Each finding has severity + ease (from suggested-fix
  complexity).
- `/iterate` §4 maps to category `external-critique`:
  HIGH→8–10, MED→5–7, LOW→2–4 impact.
- When `/iterate` ships a fix, moves row Pending → Done with
  `[x]` + commit hash.

Critique findings **compete fairly** with other audit sources.

## 9. When `/march` invokes `/critique`

`/march` reads metadata header at top of `plan/CRITIQUE.md`:

```
> Last pass: <ISO-date> at commit <sha>
> Pass count: <N>
```

**Precondition (Step 2.0 — shipping-mode gate).** Before any
of the conditions below, `/march` checks
`plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`: if **Phase 36** is not `[x]`,
the project is in shipping mode and `/critique` is **not
dispatched at all** — the conditions below are not even
evaluated. This overrides condition 1's "never + a phase
shipped" clause. See `plan/bearings.md` "Critique cadence"
(user-set 2026-05-16). The conditions below apply only once
Phase 36 has shipped.

Conditions to dispatch (post-shipping-mode only):

1. **At least 12 commits** after `Last pass` commit, OR
   `Last pass` more than **24 hours** ago, OR `Last pass` is
   "never" and at least one page-family phase has shipped.
2. `pnpm deploy:check` shows green.
3. No pending HIGH critique already queued for iterate.

If all three (and shipping mode has ended): `/march` calls
`/critique` for that tick.
