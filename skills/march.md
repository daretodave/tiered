# Skill: march

> **Outer dispatcher.** Reads project state and delegates to one
> of the shipping skills. Designed for `/loop`. The
> autonomous-beast entry point.

## 1. Purpose

`/loop /march` is the autonomous-beast mode. It picks the
right-thing-to-do every tick:

```
unlabeled issues exist          →  /triage
ELSE critique due (rate-lim)    →  /critique
ELSE pending phase              →  /ship-a-phase
ELSE pending data (category:data)  →  /ship-data
ELSE content-gap row scoring ≥3 →  /ship-content
ELSE expand due + bold posture  →  /expand
ELSE                            →  /iterate
```

Deliveries first: pending phases / data ship before `/expand`
ever fires. `/expand` only runs when there's no immediate
delivery, OR when its rate-limit window opens (every ~20
commits or ~48h) AND the bearings posture is **bold** or
**autonomous**.

This means: an overnight run can take tiered.tv from
"scaffolded" to "shipped, populated, iteratively polished,
critiqued, addressed, inbox-zero on issues, and growing its
own plan when reality outpaces the original spec" without a
mode switch from the user.

The triage check is **cheap when idle** (one API call to count
unlabeled issues). The critique check is **rate-limited**
(≥12 commits + ≥24h spacing, green-deploy required). The
expand check is **rate-limited + posture-gated** (≥20 commits
+ ≥48h, posture ≠ strict).

## 2. Invocation

```
/march                       # one tick: dispatch + execute
/loop 30m /march             # autonomous loop, every 30 min
/loop /march                 # self-paced autonomous loop
```

## 3. Procedure

### Step 0 — Sync

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

If divergence, stop per §5.

### Step 0.5 — Finale-detection gate (phase 39)

Run the idempotent finale gate before triage. It reads
`content/calendar.yml`, finds finales whose `finale_date` is in
the past with no shift note filed yet, and appends one
`category: content-gaps, source: self` row per finale into
`plan/AUDIT.md`'s `## Pending` block:

```bash
node scripts/finale-gate.mjs
```

This is a fast, side-effect-light no-op when nothing is due (and
when the calendar file is absent). It is **not** a gate that can
fail the march — exit non-zero only on an unexpected I/O error;
log it and continue. If it filed rows, they flow into the normal
content-gap dispatch (Step 3b.5) on this or a later tick. The
content drain that picks up a `source: self` finale-shift row
**may autonomously write the spoiler-safe post-finale
ranking-shift note AND adjust that season's `canonical_position`**
if the editorial rationale warrants it (oversight 2026-05-19;
spoiler discipline is P0 — the note frames the *ranking shift*,
never the winner/elimination/outcome).

### Step 1 — Triage gate (cheapest check)

Load `GH_TOKEN` from `.env` and count unlabeled open issues:

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=$(awk -F= '/^GH_TOKEN=/ {sub(/^GH_TOKEN=/, ""); print; exit}' .env)
export GH_REPO=$(awk -F= '/^GH_REPO=/ {sub(/^GH_REPO=/, ""); print; exit}' .env)
GH_REPO=${GH_REPO:-daretodave/tiered}

unlabeled=$(gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" --state open \
  --search "-label:triage:loop-queued -label:triage:needs-user -label:triage:closed -label:triage:reviewed -label:loop:opened" \
  --json number --jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
```

If `unlabeled > 0`:

- Read `skills/triage.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

If `unlabeled == 0`, fall through to Step 2.

If `gh` isn't installed or `GH_TOKEN` missing, **don't fail
the march** — log warning and fall through.

### Step 2 — Critique gate (rate-limited)

**Step 2.0 — Shipping-mode gate (hard precondition, checked
first).** Open `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md` "Status
(at-a-glance)". If the **Phase 36** row is not `[x]` (i.e. any
of the shipping-queue phases 26 / 32 / 34 / 35 / 36 is still
`[ ]`), the project is in **shipping mode**: **skip the entire
critique gate and fall straight through to Step 3.** Do not
read the metadata header, do not run `deploy:check`, do not
spawn `reader`. This precondition overrides the "never + a
phase shipped" clause below — that clause must not fire during
shipping mode. Rationale + ownership: `plan/bearings.md`
"Critique cadence" (set by the user 2026-05-16); the gate line
also appears in `plan/CRITIQUE.md`'s header. Once Phase 36 is
`[x]`, this gate lifts and the rate-limited logic below applies
normally.

Read metadata header at top of `plan/CRITIQUE.md`:

```
> Last pass: <ISO-date> at commit <sha>
> Pass count: <N>
```

Dispatch to `/critique` if **all three** hold:

1. Current commit is at least **12 commits after** `Last pass`,
   OR `Last pass` > **24 hours ago**, OR `Last pass` is "never"
   and at least one substantive phase (e.g., the canonical
   sibling) has shipped.
2. `pnpm deploy:check` shows a green deploy.
3. No pending HIGH critique already queued for iterate.

If all three hold:

- Read `skills/critique.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

Otherwise fall through to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Dispatch (first match wins)

#### 3a. Pending phase?

Open `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`. If any `[ ]` row in the
"Status (at-a-glance)" block:

- Read `skills/ship-a-phase.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

#### 3b. Pending data?

For tiered.tv: data work means Supabase migrations / RLS
changes / data ops. There's no `data/BACKLOG.md` (tiered.tv
is hybrid-with-managed-postgres, not gh-as-db). Instead,
check `plan/AUDIT.md` for `category: data` rows.

If any Pending `category: data` row scores ≥ 3.0:

- Read `skills/ship-data.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

#### 3b.5. Content-gap rows?

Open `plan/AUDIT.md`. Score all Pending rows with
`category: content-gaps` per the standard formula
(`impact × ease / 10`, then 1.5x bias multiplier if the
header reads `> Bias: content-gaps`).

If any row scores ≥ 3.0:

- Read `skills/ship-content.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

(tiered.tv has 3 live content-velocity rules in
`plan/bearings.md` "Content velocity & editorial cadence"
that consistently surface content-gap rows: show coverage,
canon completeness, themed list quota. Rule 4
(facade completeness) is retired — per-show illustration is
prohibited per `design/CLAUDE.md`. Per the 2026-06-14 oversight,
Rule 1 (show coverage) is now a **standing perpetual mandate** —
the build plan is 59/59 complete and adding new shows is the
loop's primary mission, so this dispatch is expected to fire on
most content-eligible ticks indefinitely. It drains, never
one-shots: one show flavor scaffolded per tick, seasons drained
~5/tick by Rule 2. The show queue lives as Pending content-gap
rows in `plan/AUDIT.md`; when it runs low /expand refills it.)

#### 3c. Expand due (rate-limited, posture-gated)?

Read `plan/bearings.md` "Plan expansion posture" section. If
posture is **strict**, skip to 3d.

Read metadata header at top of `plan/PHASE_CANDIDATES.md`:

```
> Last pass: <ISO-date> at commit <sha>
> Pass count: <N>
```

Dispatch to `/expand` if **all four** hold:

1. Posture is **bold** or **autonomous** (not strict).
2. Current commit is at least **20 commits after** `Last pass`,
   OR `Last pass` is more than **48 hours ago**, OR `Last pass`
   is "never" and at least **3 phases have shipped**.
3. There's at least one signal worth examining: `plan/AUDIT.md`
   has Pending rows, OR `plan/CRITIQUE.md` has Pending rows,
   OR `git log -p --since="<last pass>" -- spec.md design/`
   shows changes, OR `data/` has substantial growth since the
   plan was authored.
4. No phase or data work is pending (Steps 3a/3b would have
   matched first if there were).

If all four hold:

- Read `skills/expand.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

If any condition fails, fall through to 3d.

#### 3d. Else — iterate.

- Read `skills/iterate.md`.
- Execute its procedure end-to-end.
- Return.

(Note: when `/iterate`'s audit finds no actionable findings
scoring ≥ 3.0 AND posture is bold, iterate dispatches to
`/expand` itself rather than stopping. See `skills/iterate.md`
§6 failure mode 6.)

### Step 4 — Done

Return cleanly. Loop's next tick re-dispatches.

## 4. Hand-off honesty

When you dispatch into a child skill, **fully adopt its
contract**. Hard rules, failure modes, commit conventions,
verify gate. `/march` itself doesn't add rules; it inherits.

A march tick succeeds iff the child tick succeeds.

## 5. Failure modes

`/march` itself only fails on:

1. **`git pull` divergence.**
2. **State files corrupted or missing** (build plan, AUDIT,
   BACKLOG, CRITIQUE). Stop and report — don't reconstruct
   silently.

Otherwise inherited from the dispatched skill.

## 6. Quick reference

```bash
# State files
plan/steps/01_build_plan.md          # pending phases
data/BACKLOG.md                      # pending data work
plan/CRITIQUE.md                     # critique queue + last-pass metadata

# External signals
gh issue list ...                    # unlabeled count
pnpm deploy:check                    # green-deploy condition

# Skills it dispatches into
skills/triage.md                     # Step 1 (cheapest)
skills/critique.md                   # Step 2 (rate-limited)
skills/ship-a-phase.md               # Step 3a
skills/ship-data.md                  # Step 3b
skills/ship-content.md               # Step 3b.5
skills/expand.md                     # Step 3c (posture-gated)
skills/iterate.md                    # Step 3d
```
