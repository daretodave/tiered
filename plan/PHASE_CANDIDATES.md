# PHASE_CANDIDATES

> `/expand` reads accumulated signals (audit findings, critique
> findings, GH issues, spec drift, design landings, data
> growth) and proposes new phase candidates here. `/oversight`
> reviews and promotes them to `plan/steps/01_build_plan.md`.
>
> Posture: **bold** (per `plan/bearings.md`). `/expand` runs
> at standard cadence and files candidates here. `/oversight`
> is the only path to promote.

## Considered (awaiting promotion)

<!-- Format:

-->

### 01. RSS feeds (`/feed.xml` + `/feed/<show>.xml`)

**Score:** 5.5 (impact: 5, ease: 5, +2 multi, +1 cheap)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Source signals:**
- `spec.md:281` — spec lists "RSS + newsletter" as phase 18, but
  the build plan's phase 18 became "Performance + a11y polish"
  (spec phase 17). RSS never landed; spec/plan drift.
- Seed S4 — user-emptied seed for "Newsletter + RSS" with
  trigger "when content velocity exceeds ~15 published canons +
  5 themes." Current state: 13 shows, 12 themes, 8+ canons —
  trigger is reached.
- bearings Rules 1 + 3 quotas both cleared (phases 22 + 24
  shipped 13 shows + 12 themes); regular readers now have
  enough to subscribe to.

**Why:** RSS is the lowest-friction return-reader channel and
the only spec-promised feature still missing from the build
plan. It's also a SEO signal — feed-discovery surfaces on
aggregators that don't index regular HTML. The catalog is large
enough that "new canon, new list, new season blurb" updates
benefit from a stream. Scope is genuinely small (handwritten
XML route; no SDK; no auth) and orthogonal to other surfaces.

**Scope sketch:**
- `app/feed.xml/route.ts` — global RSS 2.0: latest items across
  shows / themed lists / canon revisions, sorted by file mtime
  or a `published` frontmatter field.
- `app/feed/[show]/route.ts` — per-show feed: that show's
  seasons + canon updates only.
- Add feed discovery `<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">`
  to relevant page heads.
- Sitemap entries for both feed routes.
- e2e: fetch `/feed.xml`, assert content-type + RSS 2.0 root +
  `<channel><item>` shape + `<link>` matches canonical URL.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** none. Spec-aligned; design has no opinion on
feeds (no UI impact beyond the discovery `<link>`).

### 02. Inline search takeover (replace `/search` route page)

**Score:** 4.0 (impact: 6, ease: 5, +1 multi, -1 scope risk)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Source signals:**
- Seed S7 — user direction 2026-05-13 ("Search needs to be
  inline (or takeover) — not a new page"). Detailed scope
  sketch already filed.
- Design landing — phase 19b shipped the new chrome with a
  `⌕ Search` icon in the header; the icon currently links to
  the standalone `/search` route, which contradicts the user's
  brief.
- bearings "Content velocity & editorial cadence" — content
  catalog now warrants frictionless cross-show search; route
  navigation breaks the browsing flow.

**Why:** The chrome already ships the search icon; the
behavior behind it is the gap. A takeover is the lowest-cost,
highest-coherence pattern with the new header — no route
change, no page transition, results highlighted in place. The
local index built in phase 15 (`src/lib/search.ts`) is reused
as-is. Risk is mostly UI affordance (keyboard, ARIA combobox
pattern, no-JS fallback) — manageable for one phase.

**Scope sketch:**
- New `<SearchTakeover>` in `src/components/chrome/`: panel
  slides down under `<TopNav>`, ARIA combobox, `<input
  type="search">` + grouped results.
- Header `⌕ Search` becomes a button toggling the takeover (no
  navigation).
- Per-keystroke local search; `<mark>` highlights in result
  titles + first blurb line.
- Keyboard: ↑/↓ navigate, Enter activate, Esc close; click
  outside closes.
- `/search?q=…` deep-link opens takeover pre-populated;
  `app/search/page.tsx` becomes the no-JS fallback.
- e2e: open via icon, type → results, keyboard nav, deep-link.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** none. The standalone `/search` page survives as
a fallback so the URL contract isn't broken.

### 03. Newsletter subscribe (Buttondown embed)

**Score:** 3.0 (impact: 4, ease: 5, +1 multi, -1 vendor)
**Source pass:** 1
**Filed:** 2026-05-14
**Source signals:**
- `spec.md:281` — same spec phase 18 row that names RSS also
  names "newsletter."
- Seed S4 — same seed names Buttondown form embed.

**Why:** Split from candidate 01 because newsletter introduces
a vendor dependency (Buttondown account + DNS records once a
domain swap lands) that RSS doesn't share. Lower priority than
RSS because RSS already serves the "return-reader" need; the
newsletter is incremental on top. File so it isn't lost — but
defer until S1 (domain swap) lands, since `noreply@pantheon.app`
or similar makes the sign-up trust signal real.

**Scope sketch:**
- `/newsletter` minimal page: Buttondown embed form, brief
  promise copy, no SDK.
- Footer link surfaces it once.
- No auth integration; subscribers list lives in Buttondown.
- e2e: page renders + form has the expected `<form action>`
  pointing at buttondown.

**Estimated phases:** 1.
**Conflicts:** depends on S1 (custom domain) for a credible
sender identity; can ship before but trust signal will be weak.

## Considered (below threshold)

### B1. `content/calendar.yml` + post-finale event triggers

**Score:** 2.0 (impact: 5, ease: 4, -2 expensive/uncertain)
**Source signals:** `spec.md:294` promises "Event triggers (a
finale air date in `content/calendar.yml`) prompt `/iterate` to
write a 'post-finale ranking shift' piece spoiler-free."
Calendar doesn't exist; no `/iterate` hook.
**Why deferred:** Single signal; the auto-write piece is
hand-wavy (what does "write a post-finale ranking shift piece"
mean in skill terms?). Worth raising again after at least one
real finale produces a hand-authored "shift" post that the
loop can pattern from.

## Seed candidates (pre-loaded for /expand to evaluate)

These aren't promoted; they're seeds the user pre-emptied so
`/expand` doesn't have to discover them. `/expand` may score,
score-and-defer, or merge with newly-discovered candidates.

### S1. Custom domain swap (`pantheon.app` → primary)

**Trigger:** when `pantheon.app` is purchased + DNS configured.
**Scope sketch:** add domain in Vercel, update Auth0 Allowed
URLs, swap `AUTH0_BASE_URL`, swap `EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` to
`noreply@pantheon.app`, run `setup/05_email.md` v2 swap,
update all hardcoded `pantheon-coral.vercel.app` refs in
content + canonicalUrl helpers.

### S2. Resend email provider migration

**Trigger:** depends on S1 (needs domain DNS).
**Scope sketch:** runbook in `setup/05_email.md` v2 path —
account, domain verify, API key, Auth0 SMTP wiring, bounce
webhook, swap from Auth0 dev SMTP. Bumps `setup/00_files.md`
05 status to ✅.

### S3. Cron-enable cloud /march

**Trigger:** after user vets the manual cloud workflow_dispatch
runs cleanly for ~1 week.
**Scope sketch:** add `schedule: - cron: '0 * * * *'` (or
similar cadence) to `.github/workflows/march.yml`. Bound by
the daily commit ceiling check and concurrency group already
in place.

### S4. Newsletter + RSS

**Trigger:** when content velocity exceeds ~15 published
canons + 5 themes (organic discovery via search starts to
matter).
**Scope sketch:** Buttondown form embed at `/newsletter` (no
SDK required); handwritten RSS 2.0 with global feed at
`/feed.xml` and per-show feeds at `/feed/<show>.xml`; sitemap
entries; e2e validates RSS 2.0 shape.

### S5. SVG → PNG OG generator

**Trigger:** after phase 17 (SEO meta) ships and per-route OG
images become a critique-finding source.
**Scope sketch:** extend `scripts/build-icons.mjs` to render
per-route OG (1200x630) compositions deriving from the show's
facade + the route's headline. `app/opengraph-image.tsx` per
route family.

### S6. Vercel Analytics dashboard review cadence

**Trigger:** ~30 days after launch (whenever real user traffic
starts).
**Scope sketch:** weekly `/oversight` checkpoint reads Vercel
Analytics dashboard; surfaces top-N pages, drop-off points,
404s; files audit rows for any URL with >5% bounce. Lightweight
human-in-loop ritual.

### S7. Inline / takeover search (replace the `/search` route page)

**Trigger:** after phase 19b ships (search icon lives in the
new header).
**Source:** user direction 2026-05-13 — "Search needs to be
inline (or takeover) — not a new page. you click the icon
(thats in the style of "Show identity, tokens and
compositions" from the design, the search expands and you can
type right there. the index is local so we don't care that we
are hitting the service per keystroke. highlight the content
that comes up with the keystroke (if we can)."

**Scope sketch:**

- Click `⌕ Search` in the header → an inline takeover slides
  down from under the topnav. No route change.
- The takeover holds a single `<input type="search">` + a
  results list below.
- Per-keystroke query against the local index built in phase
  15 (`src/lib/search.ts`). Fast — no Supabase round-trip for
  the index, since the index is content-only and built at
  request-time from the content loader.
- Highlight matching substrings in the results titles + first
  blurb line (use `<mark>` spans).
- Results group by kind: shows, seasons, themed lists.
- Escape closes the takeover. Click outside also closes.
- Keyboard: ↑/↓ navigates results; Enter activates the
  highlighted result.
- `/search?q=…` deep-link remains valid and opens the
  takeover pre-populated. The standalone `/search` page can
  redirect to `/?search=…` or simply continue to live as a
  fallback for users without JS.
- Accessibility: ARIA combobox pattern; results have
  `aria-live="polite"`.

Phase work: rewire `<Header>` (19b ships the icon link as a
stub) so the icon toggles a `<SearchTakeover>` rather than
navigating; create `<SearchTakeover>` under
`src/components/chrome/`; deprecate `src/app/search/page.tsx`
or render it as the no-JS fallback.
